EVE Tools build by Brettski.  I enjoy playing [https://secure.eve-online.com/ft/?aid=102929 EVE-Online.com], and programming to me is still a hobby.  I find the depth of EVE requiring many tools to make things easier or more fun in the game.  These are the tools I have built.  There are also EVE-Online IGB (In-Game Browser) compatible tools I have built at http://eve-igbtools.com.

[MinerReminderPage == Miner Reminder ==]

Currently, in alpha, is Miner Reminder.  A small stupid WinForms app which makes a sound or uses a notify icon to tell you to dump your cargo while mining.  
Since I spend most of my mining time doing other things, like this application, I built a reminder so I don't forget to empty my cargo and end up stopping my lasers.

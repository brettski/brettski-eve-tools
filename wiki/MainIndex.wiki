EVE Tools build by Brettski.  I enjoy playing [https://secure.eve-online.com/ft/?aid=102929 EVE-Online.com] and programming to me is still a hobby.  While playing EVE I have discovered many tools which assist me with tasks within the game.  Many of these tools I have built myself.  I started with an in-game browser (IGB) friendly website located at http://eve-igbtools.com.  A computer crash lost some of my WinForms and spreadsheet tools, so I started this project at Google to house all this new stuff.

I am always open to new EVE tools and will explore the development of any idea which comes my way.  Just send me a message through Google Code or my [http://eve-igbtools.com/contactme.aspx contact page].

== Miner Reminder == [MinerReminderPage link]

Currently, in alpha, is Miner Reminder.  A small stupid WinForms app which makes a sound or uses a notify icon to tell you to dump your cargo while mining.  
Since I spend most of my mining time doing other things, like this application, I built a reminder so I don't forget to empty my cargo and end up stopping my lasers.

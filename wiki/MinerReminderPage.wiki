= Introduction =

A small .NET 2 WinForm application which alerts you at a set time.  Since I like to read and program while doing the really boring-ass mining, I needed something to prompt me to dump my cargo before the lasers stopped.

_a short list_

* For a quick start, type in the seconds of your miner's duration and hit enter.  The timer will start on enter in the Duration text field 

* Right click on the Duration text field for a selectable list of common times.

* Under Settings you have the ability to use a notification icon (system tray icon). Once enabled you can:
    # Hide the task bar icon for the Miner Reminder
    # Show Balloon Alert--alerts will popup from your notification area (system tray)
    # Start and stop the timer from a right-click menu on the notification icon
    # Other functions from the notification icon menu
